This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on the number of hours they study. The dataset consists of two variables: hours studied and corresponding exam scores. The data is split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.

A linear regression model is trained on the training set and evaluated using the test set. Key performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are calculated to assess the model's accuracy. Finally, the model is used to predict the score for a student who studies for a given number of hours, demonstrating the practical application of the model.

This project highlights the fundamental concepts of linear regression, model evaluation, and the relationship between study time and exam performance.
